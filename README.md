## Description
    Web developers frequently have to immerse themselves in a new technology to solve a problem, with only that tool’s documentation for help. They must sift through it to find the information that matches the specific problem they’re trying to solve. 

## User Story
    AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
